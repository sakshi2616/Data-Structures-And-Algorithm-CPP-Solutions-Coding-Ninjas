POINTERS:
*int i=10--> step 1:memory allocation
step 2: memory location stored
step 3: filling up that memory

*table where memory location is stored- SYMBOL table
*WAY TO FETCH STORAGE ADDRESS- "&i"--> tells address of i:
cout<<&i<<endl;

*variables that store addresses of other variables-->POINTERS
SYNTAX- int *p=&i (meaning- p is an pointer of integer, and that integer is i)

* derefrence operator- used to get integer using address

#POINTER ARITHMETIC
* integer pointer or char pointer or any type of pointer have same size(same purpose)
* important in arrays(integers stored in continuous memory locations)
* can compare also (p1<p2 or p1>p2)
* on doing p++ --> char pointer moves 1 byte, int pointer moves 4 byte etc.

int **p2=&p 
*double pointers store address of other pointers
