#objects- basic entities with some properties and fns etc
eg: object student, properties like name age adress contact no etc
fns like change address, set roll no. etc

#class: template of properties & fns (blueprint)

#getters and setters

#constructors:

s1.student() <-|
automatically created

#this keyword= holds the address of current object

#inbuilt constructors and deconstructors
--> copy constructor: student s2(S1) (s2 is a copy of s1)
--> copy assignment operator(=) s2=s1

-->destructor: to deallocate memory, same name as class, no return type, no input arguments
~ symbol used, only called once at the time of destroying, can be declared in pvt section
